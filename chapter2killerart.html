<p style="text-indent: 25px;">
	John hung his robe on the golden hook outside the door before walking into the chamber.
     Another long day of helping people and trying to contain the insanity of the world. 
     As he crossed the threshold a smell of incense and various foods and drinks hit him like a brick wall. Instantly he felt energized. Meeting with the other council members always gives him a burst of energy and encouragement. Each of the members had their own responsibilities in the church, as well as their own flock to tend too. Inside the chamber the other 12 members, along with a few new faces, all welcomed him warmly. His time with Abby had taken longer than expected, and he was running late. The meeting was waiting for his arrival to start. He quicky grabbed a cup of coffee and took his seat. He looked around the table, at the faces of the other council members, all his senior. 
	</p><p style="text-indent: 25px;">A voice rose from the far end of the table, welcoming everyone, and an almost reverent silence fell across the room. An older man walked up and took his seat. “Good evening, Council. It has been far too long since our last meeting, and it pleases me to see everyone here, as well as the future seats of the council.” He gestured over to the new faces, all looked straight ahead without blinking. John knew that most of them were afraid to even breathe. It was not so long ago he sat there, watching the first of many meetings that he had attended since then. The High Priest continued, “Tonight we will discuss the entrance of the new members, as well as catch up on the list.” The list he spoke of was of course The Steward Conscription; a highly detailed, and meticulously maintained list of church members. To call it a list though was like calling the ocean a fish tank. The list contained thousands of pages of information, dating back centuries. Each church member could trace their entire lineage in this book. John had only seen the list a couple times; each time was only long enough to add the new data. His most recent entry was adding Abby, the day she was born, to her family’s lineage. Her family was almost wiped out during the Trials in the early part of 1693. It was around that time that the Council was formed to protect and watch the families that were deemed fit to be added to the list. Abby was once again the last in her line, and each of the council members knew everything about her, and each of them had been charged with making sure she was taken care of for her entire life, albeit in the background. They guided her in life, buried in the shadows, preventing any variation in the plan that the High Priest had put in motion. Sometimes this guidance was put in place with a friend for Abby, and sometimes it was a bit more physically placed. The church had deemed that despite Abbys clear artistic talent, painting art would not provide for her financially, and it would not serve the church in any useful area. John hated having to destroy her artwork, and wished the church has at least kept the art, but they could not risk her finding out it was them that burned her studios down, not once but on three separate occasions. After the second time, the church placed Chris with her, to push her into tattooing people instead. This would allow the church to use her to her full potential, and Abby and Chris were now together as more than friends, so he continued to be an asset for the church to utilize. Chris was on the path to become a council member sooner then most members, and it would make him the youngest member in their history. John was considering speaking to the council about what he had seen tonight with Abby, when the council member next to him nudged him. He blinked and looked to the High Priest, “I apologize Reverand, I was lost in thought. What can I do?” 
	<br></p><p style="text-indent: 25px;">The High Priest, typically a solemn and strict man, let out what one could only assume was a chuckle, though it sounded more like a soda can with rocks in it. He stared at John for what felt like an eternity until he finally spoke. “I asked how Abby was doing after her visit to your church? I have been told that she has been having the dreams like her mother did. Is this true? Is she finally ready?” John looked down at the table, feeling the ridges and cracks caused by the hands of many members before him and he considered his reply very carefully so as to not lie, nor disrupt his own plans. “Reverend, she came to see me tonight, and she was indeed scared, but did not tell me what the issues was. By the time she had calmed down enough to talk to, she jumped up and left, without even an explanation. My plan was to check on her in the next few days and confirm the dreams.   </p>
